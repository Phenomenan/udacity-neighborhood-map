# My Neighborhood Map

## This is a project for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program
Using React and Google Map API I created a guide to shopping locations in Denizli. You can filter locations and get some information about the places with Foursquare API.
- Note: I used Foursquare Free API so there is a limitation for number of requests per day.

## Installation & Running

Clone or Download the repository and run `npm install` for dependencies installation. Then run `npm start`. The application will run on http://localhost:3000/
- Warning: The service worker bundled with create-react-app so it only works in production mode not in the development mode. You can run the application in the production by running `npm run serve` and then visit http://localhost:5000/
