# My Neighborhood Map

## This is a project for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program
Using React and Google Map API I created a guide to shopping locations in Denizli. You can filter locations and get some information about the places with Foursquare API.
- Note: I used Foursquare Free API so there is a limitation for number of requests per day.
